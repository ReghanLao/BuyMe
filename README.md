## 336 Final Project - Reghan, Christian, Ali, Angelo

### Stack
1. React (Frontend)
2. Python - Flask (Backend)
3. MySQL - Database

### Project Info 
1. Create a .env file in your frontend folders and type in `VITE_API_URL=YOUR_BACKEND_URL_HERE`. Smth like `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000`. The .env file in the frontend folder tells React where the backend is located. This file is in the .gitignore for security reasons so that's why you need to create your own locally.

2. To download missing dependencies do `npm install`
